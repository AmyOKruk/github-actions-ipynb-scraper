A simple example of how to run a scraper with a Jupyter notebook and GitHub Actions.

Inspired by Simon Willison's [git scraping demo](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/7/weeknotes/) at NICAR 2021 and based on the Los Angeles Times' [California coronavirus scraper](https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-scrapers).
